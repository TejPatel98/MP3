1. The lines from 558-568 are being repeated in lines 606-616. To prevent this, we can make a method and call that method wherever needed.

3. updateComputerList() and trimLabels() are both defined in the Jenkins class, so the updateAndTrim() class can be defined there itself.

4. make a for loop that iterates over i with an increment of 1 with each iteration.

6. We chose to work with the code on line numbers 307-315 and 317-325. That can be extracted and transformed into a seperate method which needs to be called in order to refactor.
